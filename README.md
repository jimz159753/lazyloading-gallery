# Task #2: Image Optimization and Lazy Loading

## Overview

Develop a simple photo gallery application using Next.js with TypeScript. The application should implement image optimization and lazy loading techniques to ensure efficient loading and display of images.

## Requirements

1. **Application Development**
   - **Framework**: Next.js (with TypeScript).
   - **Feature**: Implement image optimization and lazy loading for a photo gallery.
   - **Data Model**: Define a TypeScript model representing photos, including metadata such as URLs and captions.
   - **API Routes**: Create API routes to fetch photo data from a datasource or a mock service.

2. **Implementation Details**
   - **Image Optimization**:
     - Utilize Next.jsâ€™s built-in `Image` component to handle image optimization.
     - Ensure images are responsive and optimized for various screen sizes.
   - **Lazy Loading**:
     - Implement lazy loading for images to improve initial load times and user experience.
   - **Data Model**:
     - Define TypeScript types and interfaces to represent photo objects, including properties such as URL and caption.
   - **API Routes**:
     - Implement API routes using Next.js API routes to serve photo data. You can use a mock datasource if a real one is not available.

3. **Improvement Commentary**
   - **Code Efficiency**:
     - Discuss potential improvements for handling larger datasets and optimizing image delivery.
   - **User Experience**:
     - Suggest enhancements for better performance, such as using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or additional lazy loading techniques.
   - **Error Handling**:
     - Consider improvements for handling errors gracefully, such as fallback images or loading states.

4. **Testing**
   - **Unit Tests**:
     - Write tests to verify that individual components, such as the image gallery and API routes, function correctly.
   - **Integration Tests**:
     - Test the interaction between the image components, API routes, and data sources.
   - **Concurrent Usage**:
     - Include tests to verify that the application performs well under concurrent usage, ensuring stability and responsiveness.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Next.js with TypeScript**
   - Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript support.
   - Install necessary dependencies.

2. **Define Data Model**
   - Create TypeScript interfaces or types to represent photo objects.
   - Example: `types/Photo.ts`.

3. **Develop the Photo Gallery**
   - Implement a photo gallery component using the `Image` component from Next.js for optimization.
   - Include lazy loading for

## Installation

To get your development environment ready, you need to install the application's dependencies. 

**Steps:**

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project where the `package.json` file is located.
3. Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

   This command will download and install all the libraries and packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## Running the App

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the application in development mode.

**Steps:**

1. Make sure you are still in the root directory of the project.
2. Run the following command to start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   This command will launch the application, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if configured differently). You can open this URL in your web browser to view and interact with the app.

## Testing the App

To ensure the application is functioning correctly and that all features work as expected, you can run the test suite.

**Steps:**

1. With the dependencies installed and the development server stopped, run the following command to execute the tests:

    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```

   This command will run all the test cases defined in the project. Tests help verify that the app behaves correctly and that no new changes have broken existing functionality.

## Summary

- **To install the app**, use `npm install`.
- **To run the app**, use `npm run dev`.
- **To test the app**, use `npm run test`.

Following these steps will help you set up, run, and test the application effectively. If you encounter any issues, consult the project's documentation or reach out for support.
